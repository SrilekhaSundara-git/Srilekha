What assertion checks that a value exists in a list? Provide an example.

The assertIn assertion is used to check that a value exists in a list (or any other iterable sequence).

self.assertIn(15, [20, 15])

What assertion checks that an object is not made from a specific class? Provide an example.

The assertNotIsInstance assertion is used to validate that an object is not instantiated from a specific class.

self.assertNotIsInstance(5, str)

What does the final argument to any assertion represent?

The final argument to any assertion is an optional error message to be displayed in the output if the assertion fails.

Provide an example of an assertion that tests that a piece of code raises a NameError.

import unittest

class UndeclaredVariableExample(unittest.TestCase):
  def test_divide(self):
    with self.assertRaises(NameError):
      x

if __name__ == "__main__":
  unittest.main()
What is the difference between the assertIs and assertEqual assertions?

The assertEqual assertion checks that two objects are equal, meaning the values they hold are the same.

The assertIs assertion checks that two names in the program refer to the same object in memory.
