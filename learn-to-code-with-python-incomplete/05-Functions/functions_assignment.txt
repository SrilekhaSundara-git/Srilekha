What is a function?

A function is a procedure, with the sequence of the steps to be performed.

Tell me a little about parameters, arguments, and return values.

A parameter is a variable in a method definition. When a method is called, the arguments are the data you pass into the method's parameters. A return keyword is specified inside the function, sometimes referred to as the end of the statement in the method.

What is a default argument? How do you define one?

a default argument is an argument to a function that a user is not required to specify on the function call.

What data type represents nothingness or nonexistence or emptiness?

None type

What is the difference between positional arguments and keyword arguments?

positional arguments: arguments passed to a function in the correct positional order.

Keyword arguments are arguments that identify the parameters by their names.
