Operator:
An operator represents a single task in a workflow that helps to carry out your task.
DAGs only describe ‘how’ to run a workflowand they do not perform any actual action.
On the other side, operators determine what actually gets to be done when your DAG runs.
Now talking about its categories, Operators (in general) are classified into 3 main categories.

1.Sensor Operators
2.Transfer Operators 
3.Action Operators
1. Sensor Operators
    Sensor operator will keep on checking that location on regular intervals and will only

    move ahead once the required file arrives.

    Not only file, sensor operators can be used in any case where you need some event to get

    happened before other tasks can start.

    Its Examples include an HdfsSensor waiting for a file landing in HDFS, a normal filesensor

    etc.

2.  We have transfer operators like MySqlToHiveTransfer operator that moves data from MySQL to Hive

    location and S3ToRedshiftTransfer operator to transfer the files from s3 to Redshift

    system.

3. The operator name itself will tell you what action it is going to perform.

    The BashOperator that was used is tutorial example to trigger Bash commands is one such

    example of Action operators.

    Not only BashOperator we have more action operators like PythonOperator to call an arbitrary

    python function, then we have HiveOperator to execute any Hive script, BigQueryOperator

    that executes Google BigQuery SQL and many more.
