How does the rfind method work?

The rfind() method returns the highest index of the substring (if found). If not found, it returns -1.

Provide 3 examples of the rfind method in action. Write the invocation along with the return value.

quote = 'Let it be, let it be, let it be'
 
result = quote.rfind('let it')
print("Substring 'let it':", result)
 
result = quote.rfind('small')
print("Substring 'small ':", result)
 
quote = 'Do small things with great love'
print(quote.rfind('th', 6, 20))
