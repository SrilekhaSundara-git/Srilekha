What is recursion?

Recursion is when a function invokes or calls itself within it's own body. Python keeps track of each execution separately.

Provide two examples of truthy values and two examples of falsy values. Do not use True or False.



A empty string or the number zero evaluate to a falsy value. While a string with characters or positive values evaluates to a truthy value.

True or False: elif cannot be used in combination with else. Itâ€™s either one or the other.



False an if statement can be accompanied by several elifs statements and else statement.

What is an infinite loop? How can you accidentally create one?

An infinite loop is one which occurs when a program does not have a conditional statement that makes it terminate. It continues to run until the program runs out of memory.

An infinite loop can be accidently created when a program always evaluates to True.

Pick either the and keyword or the or keyword and describe what it does.

or keyword evaluates to True if either one of two conditions is True. It evaluates to False if  both conditions are False.
